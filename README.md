## Description

The 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) PCB is a custom-designed printed circuit board created by Sohaila Esmat using Eagle PCB design software. It serves as an interface between a microprocessor and peripheral devices, providing versatile I/O capabilities for digital systems.

## Features

- **Versatile I/O:** Supports three independent 8-bit I/O ports configurable as inputs or outputs.
- **Mode Selection:** Flexibility to configure each port as mode 0 (basic input/output), mode 1 (strobe input/output), or mode 2 (bi-directional bus).
- **Address Decoding:** Incorporates address decoding logic to select the appropriate device when multiple peripherals are present.
- **Eagle PCB Design:** Designed using Eagle PCB design software, ensuring reliability and compatibility with industry-standard workflows.

## Design Files

- **Schematic:** The schematic diagram of the 8255 PPI PCB is provided in Eagle `.sch` format.
- **PCB Layout:** The PCB layout design files are available in Eagle `.brd` format.
- **Gerber Files:** Gerber files for manufacturing the PCB are included for easy fabrication.
